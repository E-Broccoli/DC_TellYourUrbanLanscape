The Tell Your Urban Landscape app enables the collection of  memories related to the ........ area in Canongate, Edinburgh.

Have you a memory related to existing or demolished buildings there? 
Have you memories of that part of Edinburgh in the past? Are you a long time resident of Canongate or did you live there years ago?  Tell us the urban landscape you lived in or you remember.
How did that area of Canongate look like?

This application loads a map of Ediburgh and the goal is really simple: navigate the map in order to find the place/building of your memory.
When you find it, please adds a marker to indicate the position and save it pushing the coordinates button.

You can now use the Memory Box to tell us your story, and if you hold an old pic of the place, please send it to us at deepcities@....we will create a collection which we would be happy to display later during an exhibition at the University of Stirling.

This app is part of the Deep Cities project (https://curbatheri.niku.no/), which studies Sustainable Urban Transformations through Heritage. 
Your memories and pics will be part of a digital inventory of Canongate area that will be shared with urban planners and heritage experts. This is a way to let them hear your voice and collect all the place values.
