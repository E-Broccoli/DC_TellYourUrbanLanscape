This app enables the collection of current experiences and past memories related to the current New Waverley area in North Canongate, Edinburgh.

Are you a resident of the area or have you lived here or visited in the past?
Weâ€™d love to hear from you!

This application loads a map of North Canongate, Edinburgh and the goal is simple: find a place or building that is significant to you in the map and add a marker to indicate its position.
Then, write in the Memory Box why this place is significant to you, for example by sharing a story.

This app is part of the Deep Cities project (https://curbatheri.niku.no/), which studies Sustainable Urban Transformations through Heritage. Your memories and pics will be part of a digital inventory of the Canongate area that will be shared with urban planners and heritage experts. This is a way to let them hear your voice and collect all the place values, so that they could contribute to drive future decisions on your city.
